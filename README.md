# Introduction
R3 Auth is a 2-factor authentication system using voice recognition. R3 authentication extracts over 15 different Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and compares them against
the same by our own statistical model. Using these features, we  determine if
the specific candidate logging in is authorized to do so. The different coefficients allows our
system to validate every user and ensure that the login is adequately secure.

## Features
