signal – the audio signal from which to compute features. Should be an N*1 array
samplerate – the samplerate of the signal we are working with.
winlen – the length of the analysis window in seconds. Default is 0.025s (25 milliseconds)
winstep – the step between successive windows in seconds. Default is 0.01s (10 milliseconds)
numcep – the number of cepstrum to return, default 13
nfilt – the number of filters in the filterbank, default 26.
nfft – the FFT size. Default is 512.
lowfreq – lowest band edge of mel filters. In Hz, default is 0.
highfreq – highest band edge of mel filters. In Hz, default is samplerate/2
preemph – apply preemphasis filter with preemph as coefficient. 0 is no filter. Default is 0.97.
ceplifter – apply a lifter to final cepstral coefficients. 0 is no lifter. Default is 22.
appendEnergy – if this is true, the zeroth cepstral coefficient is replaced with the log of the total frame energy.
winfunc – the analysis window to apply to each frame. By default no window is applied. You can use numpy window functions here e.g. winfunc=numpy.hamming
